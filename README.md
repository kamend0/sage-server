# Sage Recipes App

This project is for my girlfriend Alissa, who wanted something that would tell her what meals she could make with the ingredients she had on hand. She loves sage green.

This is written in Django; a React frontend is to come. The recipes are stored in a MongoDB via MongoDB Atlas and images on AWS S3.

# Data Used

See "sage-data" repo for Python code used for data cleaning and loading to MongoDB Atlas and AWS S3.
